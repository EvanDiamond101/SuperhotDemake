# Superhot Demake

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/gfhghIL.png" width="30%">

A recreation of Superhot in the style of an Atari 2600 game. Created in just over a week as a game jam.

The project attempted to use a colour palette, resolution, and sound style similar to that of an Atari 2600 game, while keeping the core mechanics and tone of Superhot.
